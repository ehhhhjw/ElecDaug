The Original shows the original model training process.
Radio noise metamorphic operator completes the process of simulating mechanical thermal noise and Gaussian white noise in the signal transmission process by injecting radio noise into the electromagnetic signal data.
Signal outage metamorphic operator simulates the scenario of partial data missing due to transmission transient interruption during electromagnetic signal transmission.
Signal disruption metamorphic operator simulates the signal delay during signal transmission by selecting a continuous segment of signal data and changing the data to the $I/Q$ average of this continuous data.
Channel transformation metamorphic operator is mainly to simulate the time-domain interaction caused by the interference of adjacent electromagnetic signals in the timing sequence during signal propagation.
Power zooming metamorphic operator takes into account the phenomenon of signal energy superposition due to reflection of the signal.
